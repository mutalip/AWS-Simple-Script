You can use the CLI tools to manage your Amazon EC2 resources (such as instances, security groups, and volumes)
and your Amazon VPC resources (such as VPCs, subnets, route tables, and Internet gateways). Before you can start
using the tools, you must download and configure them. The following are valid CLI commands for EC2 instances:
ec2-accept-vpc-peering-connection

ec2-allocate-address
ec2-assign-private-ip-addresses
ec2-associate-address
ec2-associate-dhcp-options
ec2-associate-route-table
ec2-attach-internet-gateway
ec2-attach-network-interface (not ec2-allocate-interface)
